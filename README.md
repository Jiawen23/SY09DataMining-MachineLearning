# SY09DataMining-MachineLearning
Short description: Study of the principal methods of multidimensional data analysis used in data mining allowing the retrieval of knowledge starting from great volumes of data

#### Reference work 
"The Elements of Statistical Learning - Data Mining, Inference and Prediction" by T. Hastie, R. Tibshirani et J. Friedman (Springer, 2001) and "Pattern Classification", (2nd ed) by R. Duda, P. Hart et D. Stork (Wiley, 2000)

#### Particularities:

#### Course objective :	

At the end of the course, the student will be able to understand and use the most usual data science and data mining techniques (statistical learning and in particular clustering and classification, exploratory data analysis, data visualization and representation).

#### Specific pedagogical objectives :	
At the end of the course, the student will be able to:
- identify the various types of machine learning problems, model a practical problem as a learning problem; 
- apply the usual data visualization techniques (exploratory data analysis, factor analysis) so as to guide the choice of more advanced techniques; 
- understand and apply the most classical clustering techniques (K-means, hierarchical clustering); 
- understand the principles of supervised learning and Bayesian decision theory; 
- understand and apply the most classical classification techniques (discriminant analysis, logistic regression, decision trees, linear regression).

Keywords :

Program :	
Introduction: examples of problem of prediction; supervised and unsupervised training; Multidimensional statistics: random vectors and descriptive statistics; Geometrical representations of the data; Principal component analysis; Factorial discriminant analysis; Clustering : k-means algorithm and agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm of Ward; Mixture model and clustering; Mixture model and clustering; Kohonen's Self-Organizing Map; Methods of regression.

Results :	At the end of this course, the students must be able of: to process and describe the data contained in large data set; to understand the mechanisms justifying the use of a particular method; to solve problems with real data.
